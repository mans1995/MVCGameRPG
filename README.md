# MVCGameRPG

Simple 2D RPG following the Model-View-Controller pattern using JFrame made by a group of two people including myself. We don't own the graphics.

Use:
- Arrow keys to move.
- Enter to interact with doors and loot.
- X to attack or use a potion.
- 1, 2 or 3 to select an inventory category.
- C to swith the currently used item.
- E to buy an item in the shop.
- R to throw an item.
- ESC to access the menu (where you can load/save/quit the game).
