# MVCGameRPG

Simple RPG made by a group of two people including myself. We don't own the graphics.

Use:
- Arrow keys to move
- Enter to interact with doors and loot
- X to attack or use a potion
- 1, 2 and 3 to select an inventory category
- C to swith the currently used item
- E to buy an item in the shop
- R to throw an item
- ESC to access the menu (where you can load/save/quit the game)
